python scripts

The scripts in the python repository are short utility scripts.

mass_macro_walker_git.py: This script loops through all Excel files in the same folder, runs macros in each file, and saves each file with a new name. The user is prompted to enter the path to the directory with the files in it, and a prefix to add to the file name to indicate that it has been processed by the script.
