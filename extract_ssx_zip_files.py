ABOUT: This script extracts all zip files in a directory to a new folder in that
same directory named the same as the zip file. SSX refers to the original file
extension that was compressed into a zip file so that its contents could
then be extracted. The original ssx files were saved as [filename].ssx.zip.

.ssx files are proprietary files created by a company that manufactures
CPR manikins that collect data about the CPR session for the purpose of
training. The data is downloadable from the manikin in the form of a .ssx file.
The files can be opened by converting them to zip files, which can then
be extracted.
